## Religion
### The Green Path
The religion of the people, it’s spread across Ryll since people first hatched. The belief that “A natural being must follow their natural purpose: to grow, to change, to share, to die.” There are many different sub-sects that follow hundreds of branching ideas, from following a single magical beast, to merely being a philosophical position, nearly all are welcome in walking the Green Path.
### Elementism
The belief that the world is built on 4 main elements: Earth, Air, Water, Fire. This extends to even the souls of people being aligned with these elements. A type of pseudo-pop psychology to some (e.g. astrology) and a defining feature of all life to others, this belief has grown across the Ryll and it is nearly as old as the Green Path. Followers are typically very focused on community and art, seeking harmony among the elements.
### The Stained God
A religion from the far north, this belief is that there is one god and he is angry. Worshipers follow and plead with this god to avoid his wrath and all ills can certainly be blamed on the Stained God. Some believe themselves to be the tools of his wrath, dolling punishment out, while others might fast or use more extreme forms of self-neglect to punish themselves.
### Sublism
This religion rejects the idea of any higher beings deserving worship. Mortals and their achievements are deserving of worship in their own rights. Striving to be the best at any given field, making a legacy and name for yourself, and fighting to be remembered is more worthy than giving crops to some ancient being.
### The Truth
There is one path and it’s the truth. This belief is the idea that all insight is revealed by an entity known as “The Truth'' and all other ideas are lies. Most of their followers are Alchemists, and eventually some do go through a process known as Verisification, whereby one submits part of their soul to truth, to gain insight into the world, and can perform Alchemy. Not all Alchemists follow “The Truth'', but the majority do.
### Warrior and Priest
Also known as The Consortium, this religion upholds the idea that promises and contracts are sacred, none more sacred than the promises of parents and spouses. Followed by many government officials, traders, and city folk, this religion upholds that your word is your bond, and a bond should not be broken..They also venerate the ideas of protection and ensuring those around you are safe and cared for. 

### The Sun-King

The firebird, phoenix of life. The source of creation. A new cult formed around the phoenix known as Kaustra. They are a strict passionate group, sword to root out and aid all peoples. Aggressively expanding and easily the most organized of all the religions.

## Cultures
### Stallish

Stoic people who typically have long, white, hair, regardless of species or race. They are superstitious and can seem to have a rough exterior. A cool under pressure vibe mixes well with their try not to be noticed demeanor. People might mistakenly view them as unfriendly, but you merely need to be direct. 

### Rivian

The Rivian people are the inheritors of the promised lands, founded millenia ago by those who conquered the beasts while migrating here. Not to be outdone, many Rivians stand on the shoulders of giants and try to reach ever higher. But it is a dangerous world outside the walls and in the forests, so civility and tradition mean much to them. 

### Ontician

The proud Ontician people are no nonsense workers, who are constantly trying to be their best selves. Their long and storied past makes each Ontician a part of one large family, and its easy for outsiders to be included too. Just dont take them arguing with you as a bad thing. Studied and intelligent, Onticians love arguing and solving problems together

### Najili

The Najili horse people are one of the few true nomadic cultures left. They are wild and untamed, and any is welcome on the caravan if you can keep up. Their long history of fighting ruthless monsters in the fields means every Najili knows how to fight, and fights to the death. Each challenge deserves your best. 


### Gorish or Gors

The Gorish people are quiet and ritual people. Calm and still. They will almost never shout and argue and would rather walk away than deal with someone challenging. Water finds a crack they say. They will quickly find an efficient way to work, in order to get back to playing. Especially playing Fasyr, the king of games. 

### Durnish or Durn-folk

Rough mountain people the term durn actually means “Underground”. These people have come to the surface to connect and interact, but still retain many of underground societies' quirks. Headstrong and stubborn the Durnish rarely lose their behaviors, even after dwelling in Ryll for a long time. 

Talk with me and make up some underground quirk. Keep it in the tone

### Yonti

The people of the Riverlands view the world as simple things, weaved complexly, like the rivers themselves. Their food has a natural, tame flavor with few ingredients. Their art is refined into shapes and colors. They might seem naive but they maintain a true curiosity of how the world is made. 

### Madeenan

Loud, bombastic, in your face Madeenans are excitable and enthusiastic. Nothing gets them down. They love art and poetry and food and anything to get them out of working too hard. But don't let that fool you as many of the wealthiest in Ryll are Madeenan. True connoisseurs they love exploring and try to keep things light and have a good time, while never getting bogged down in how things have always been.
